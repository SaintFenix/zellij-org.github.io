[Zellij 0.16.0 is out](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/releases/tag/v0.16.0)!

You can download a prebuilt binary in the above link or install it through cargo with `cargo install zellij` (unaffiliated releases might also be available for your distribution or in homebrew).

We're constantly working on improving [Zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij) and releasing new features and bug fixes. Today, on this last day of August, we're releasing a large version with so many fixes and improvements we felt it warranted a post with a walkthrough.

So what's new?

### New Pane UI
Screens today are getting larger and terminal windows can take up more space. We feel we can take advantage of that space by having Zellij draw a frame around each pane.

Not only does this provide for a clearer and more sleek display, it also allows us to see the pane title (what would normally be displayed as the window title in a terminal window) as well as display the scrollback position for each pane.

If you don't like this feature, you can toggle it on/off at at runtime with `Ctrl-p` + `z`. You can also start Zellij with this option turned off, either as a command line option:

`zellij options --no-pane-frames`

Or by adding the following line to your configuration:

`no_pane_frames: true`

In the future, we plan to present more information here such as the users focused on this pane in multiple-user sessions, the last command exit code, and more.

### The session name is now displayed in the top bar
This makes it much easier to attach and re-attach to the same session later. The random yet Human-readable session names are generated by the cool [names](https://crates.io/crates/names) package.

### Resizing panes with `Ctrl-r` has been changed to `Ctrl-n`
Keybindings, especially in an application such as Zellij, are a hard problem. We tried to choose ones that are both intuitive and unintrusive. We've received a lot of feedback on this one and so decided to change it.

Zellij will no longer "hijack" `Ctrl-r` - which is a very popular keybinding in both bash and vim - and instead use `Ctrl-n`.

While this has always been configurable (and one could also lock the interface with `Ctrl-g` to get around this problem) - sane defaults are important to us. And so we made this change.

### New resizing algorithm
Resizing the whole terminal window now keeps panes in their proportional sizes.
This is a big deal for us, since Zellij does not keep track of panes in a tree structure like most multiplexers do, in order to allow for greater freedom when resizing panes.

 We implemented a constraint system in order to achieve this that in the future will allow users to describe layouts in the form of "pane X is above pane Y and always smaller than pane Z" instead of dictating a rigid YAML tree structure.

### Indication when text is copied to the clipboard
Copying text to the clipboard in Zellij is possible with the mouse in a way that is pane and scrollback aware. This is done on mouse-release once text is marked. Up until now, it has been a little confusing if you're unaware this is happening. So now we indicate this in the UI.

{{<figure src="/img/sixteen-post-clipboard.png">}}

Note that copying to the clipboard doesn't yet work with Gnome Terminal due to this issue: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte/-/issues/125

### Layout Changes
This release separates the pane layouts into "template" and "tabs". This currently allows specifying a layout that is common to all tabs, as well as different layouts for each tab. We hope this will make it easier to start Zellij with a more complex layout for creating dashboards and workspaces. For more information and examples: https://zellij.dev/documentation/layouts-templates.html

The Zellij default layouts can now also be dumped to STDOUT to make it easier for layout authors to get started: `zellij setup --dump-layout [LAYOUT_]` [default, strider, disable-status]

### And many more!
This release includes quite a few more features and bug fixes. For the full changelog, see the release:
